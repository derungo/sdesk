## About <a name = "about"></a>

SDESK is a utility designed to manage and generate .desktop files for Snap packages. It simplifies accessing Snap applications directly from desktop environments by ensuring they have corresponding .desktop files in the `/usr/share/applications` directory. The utility lists Snap packages that lack .desktop files and facilitates their creation, allowing users to customize which packages to process.
